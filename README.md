This is a simple shopping list "API/website" thing.

Set UP:
*  ```npm i```
*  ```node server.js```


Run Tests:
* ``` npx jest ```


Notes:
*  I have some example items in dataBase.json. If you don't want any of the example items, you can delete this file,
and it will make a new one when you add items.

*  The search bar isn't good it only works if you type in the exact name of the item.

* If you are running tests the dataBase.json file will be over written.
